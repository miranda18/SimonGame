# Simon Says Game

The purpose of this site was to practice DOM manipulation and game logic. 

## Functionality: 

User is thrown into the game as soon as they visit the site. To begin the game, any key can be pressed. 
Once the key is pressed, the game begins, and the first sound is played. As the user progresses the Level is incremented, and the previous pattern is played before the new sound is played. Once the user gets the pattern wrong, the losing tone is played, and the user is prompted if they would like to play again.
